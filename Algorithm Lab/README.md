# Algorithm Lab

* All the programs are written in C++.
* At starting of all programs some functions are used to set the programs to run on same CPU and set the priority as highest so they won't be preemted, thus giving us consistent times on every run.
* For the 4 assignment the graph is given as directed weighted.

```
Note: quick linear in 1 assignment is wrong as it uses the same number of comparisons compared to normal linear search program.
