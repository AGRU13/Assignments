Thread is a lightweight process. Threads shares the process context.

Prove that the average time taken for the creation of threads is less than the average time taken for the creation of processes.

Threads once created are equal. 
Prove that you can create a thread within a thread. 
Show that any thread can be killed by any other thread unless it is in detached state. 
Show that if a thread is detached then no other thread can kill the detached thread. 
Show how a particular thread can collect the return status of another thread when it (the latter) is terminated.

Open a file inside the main thread. 
Create two threads inside the main thread. 
Show that the opened file is shared between the threads. 
Also, show that a common variable declared inside the main is amenable to changes from within both the threads.

Create a scenario where a master thread will create a set of slave threads and the master will wait until the slave threads are completed (use of pthread_join may be necessary).
