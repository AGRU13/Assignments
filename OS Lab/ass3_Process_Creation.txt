How to create a process in UNIX? [using the system call fork()]. 
Prove that the address space for the child is copied from the parent. [Think of a variable which is defined in the parent and then the child is forked, see if in the child the same value of the variable is reflected]. 
Show that in the child the return value of fork is zero whereas in the parent the return value is the pid (process id) of the child. 
Check the maximum number of child processes you can create in the system from your login. [write a small code which will execute the fork call in a while loop probably].
