# Note

* All the programs are written in C using the librarires available in linux and so most of them will not run on windows.
* Every program is copied somewhere from the internet XD. Content/code from multiple sites might have been used to write some programs.
* Web crawler is the biggest one and is written in C although python would be preferable for that. Web crawler program doesn't work properly it just does something XD.
